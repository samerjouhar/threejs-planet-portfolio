        <h3>Condensis.xyz | TreeHacks 2023</h3>
        <p>
          Winner of <strong>Best Natural Language Hack</strong> at Stanford University's annual hackathon. 
          Developed an app that integrates <code>OpenAI Whisper</code> and <code>GPT</code> into a multimodal NLP system that lets students 
          upload university lecture videos and generate high-quality LaTeX notes focused on content analyses, 
          rather than brief summaries. Created an ML pipeline-UI using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Bootstrap</strong>.

        <h3>Shr√ºming | VT Hacks 2022</h3>
        <p>
          Winner of <strong>Best ML Sustainability Hack</strong> at Virginia Tech's annual hackathon. 
          Built a website with <strong>React</strong> that allows users to upload images of mushrooms to an image classification 
          machine learning model using <code>PyTorch</code>. The resulting genus classification was displayed using a mapping 
          API to show natural habitats by state and correlation with carbon emissions events by county.
